# Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index

![Image of Main Page](/)

## Introduction

https://cbeci.org is an online dashboard that visualizes the total bitcoin network power. It is hosted by the University of Cambridge Judge Business School's Centre for Alternative Finance. It is difficult to accurately calculate the electricity consumption of the bitcoin network, so the CBECI computes a 'best-guess' estimate based on calculated lower and upper bounds. The organization attempts to provide a constantly-updating, standardized metric that helps viewers understand the bitcoin network's electricity use.

The website consists of the main estimates (Image 1). It also has a chart tracking the metric over time (Image 2). A map of mining power use by country is also provided (Image 3). Additionally, they provide the methodology and processes for calculating the index (Image 4).

As shown in Image 3, the dashboard includes a web map component to visualize mining electricity use around the world. It is extremely bare bones, without a legend, north indicator, scale indicator, etc.; but it is a simple map of the world that does not attempt to provide any detailed geographic data. Therefore, only the absent legend is detrimental to the understanding provided by the map. The proportional symbols alone do not convey enough information to construct a satisfying visualization. Correspoding values in a legend would help furthur my understanding of the topic. 

Bitcoin is ever-more ubiqutous in the common lexicon and people are searching for information at ever-increasing rates. The CBECI is an important resource for people who want to discover more about bitcoin's energy use and contribution to global CO2 emissions. One of the main criticisms of bitcoin is the amount of electricity used to support the network. This dashboard is the best guess for current energy usage, and can help individuals and organizations shape their opinions of bitcoin's efficacy.

All of the dynamic data used in the model parameters comes from https://coinmetrics.io. 

The following is an excerpt from the CBECI's author recognition page:

>The CBECI is an ongoing project created and maintained by the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Programme Team (Michel Rauchs, Apolline Blandin, Anton Dek, and Yue Wu) at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, University of Cambridge, Judge Business School. Special thanks go to Kyrylo Manakhov for designing the website and to Marc Bevand, Lena Klaaßen, and Christian Stoll for reviewing the methodology. The research team would also like to thank Keith Bear, Kieran Garvey, Grigory McKain, Stephen McKeon, Robert Wardrop, and Bryan Zhang for providing valuable feedback and suggestions. Furthermore, we would like to express our gratitude to Alexi Anani, and Hatim Hussain for their contributions to this project.
